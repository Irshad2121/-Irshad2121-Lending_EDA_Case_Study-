# Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring Patterns in Lending Club Loan Data

## Project Description:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to extracting insights from complex datasets. In this project, we conduct an EDA on loan data sourced from excel file. The dataset contains information regarding loan statuses, including active loans, paid-off loans, and defaulted loans. Our objective is to find out underlying patterns and trends from past loan records to facilitate informed decision-making in future lending.
