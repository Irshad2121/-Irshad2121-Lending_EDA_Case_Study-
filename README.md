## General Information
- The Lending Club Case Study aims to analyze loan data from the Lending Club platform.
- The project explores the background of the lending industry and investigates trends and patterns within the dataset.
- The business problem addressed by this project is to understand the factors influencing loan approval and repayment, identify risk factors associated with default, and optimize lending strategies.

## Conclusions
- Analysis shows that there is a significant difference in median loan amounts between fully paid and charged-off customers.
- Customers applying for a 60-month term tend to have higher median interest rates, especially those who default.
- Grade G loans have a greater median compared to any other category, while Grade F tends to have a higher median loan amount in charged-off and current status.
- Employees with more than 9 years of experience tend to have a higher median loan amount, especially among charged-off cases.
